## Reqs

- Microsoft VS 2022
- Latest ASP.NET vers
- microsoft sql server
- sql server management studio
- You can use this database (may not be up-to-date) -> https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YaCCetRyer9-kFhLw1ZXdmp3sHoKCO84?usp=sharing
(SQL Mangement Studio doesn't work on MAC so if you are on IOS just create the database matching the entities in concrete for the tables)
- Also you have to change the connection string at DataAccess
